# Data_visualizer
The project is a data visualization web application built using Python's Flask framework. It allows users to visualize data from a CSV file through various types of graphs and charts. The application loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame and categorizes the columns as unique or non-unique. The user interface enables users to select specific columns and graph types for visualization. Upon submission, the Flask app generates the selected graphs using matplotlib, converts them into base64-encoded images, and displays them on the web page. The application provides an interactive and user-friendly way to explore and analyze data visually without requiring users to write any code.
