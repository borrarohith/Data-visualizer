# Data_visualizer
The project is a data visualization web application developed with Python's Flask framework. It enables users to visualize CSV file data through different types of graphs and charts. The application reads the data into a Pandas DataFrame and classifies the columns as unique or non-unique. Through the user interface, users can choose specific columns and the type of graph they want to create. Upon submission, the Flask app generates the graphs using matplotlib, encodes them as base64 images, and displays them on the web page. This interactive and user-friendly tool allows users to explore and analyze data visually without needing to write any code.
